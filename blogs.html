            <h1> HOW DOES HARD DISK DRIVES WORK ?</h1>
            <small>February 29, 2020</small>
            <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f5imcm6CvLs/XlpLRwMwa8I/AAAAAAAAAEo/y1vz-P7LLlIMjwRuHvyI2HtMtH_nj6AGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/HDD.jpg" alt="" class="section-img">
            <p>Storing data now a days has became a very simple task. Invention of many storage devices made storing and sharing of data very simple.
                There are many devices which are used to store the data and remove it whenever required without damaging it. One of those devices is our a HARD DISK DRIVE, which is one of the greatest innovation of all the scientists and engineers which made the storing and sharing of data very simple.
               
               Have you ever thought about the technology that allows to store so much of data just in a device equal to the size of a palm of a hand?
               Ever heard a concept of "magnetic storage"?</p>

               <p>In the heart of every modern HDD(HARD DISK DRIVE), there's a stack of high speed spinning disks, with a arm like structure a kind of flying over each surface called a recording head.
                Each disk is coated with a film of microscopic magnetized metal grains.
                The data is recorded as a magnetic pattern formed by the group of these tiny grains. Each group of pattern is known as a BIT(binary digit) in which all the grains has a magnetization in one of two possible state(directions) denoted by 0's and 1's.
                </p>

                <p>Data is stored in disk by converting the strings of bits into electric current fed through electromagnet. This magnet generates a field which is strong enough to change the direction of magnetization of grains.</p>

                <p>Now in case you want to remove data from the drive, there's a magnetic reader which turns the magnetic data stored into information (useful form).</p>
                <p>One letter takes 1 byte (8 bits) and an average photo takes several megabytes (nearly 8 to 9 million bits).</p>
                <p>Today's modern hard drive can store 300 million times than that of IBM's first hard drive made in 1950's to 1960's.
                    Today's modern hard drives has a capacity upto 20Tbits/in<sup>2</sup> by using a technology called
                    H.A M.R (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording).</p>
